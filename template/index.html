        1. Conceptual Foundation
    </h4>

    <p class="fs-5">
            Face recognition is a computer vision technique that involves detecting and analyzing
        human facial features to identify or classify individuals. In this project, the focus
        is on gender classification using facial recognition. The theoretical basis lies in the
        idea that facial structures contain distinguishable patterns that can be mathematically
        represented and classified. By leveraging machine learning models, these patterns are
        extracted, transformed into feature vectors, and used to predict whether a detected
        face belongs to a male or female category. The system integrates traditional computer
        vision methods like Haar Cascade classifiers with modern machine learning algorithms
        to achieve reliable predictions.

        2. Machine Learning Pipeline
    </h4>

    <p class="fs-5">
            The pipeline begins with face detection using Haar Cascade Classifiers, which scan
        grayscale images to locate regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to faces. Once
        detected, these ROIs undergo preprocessing steps such as normalization, resizing,
        and flattening to ensure consistency in input data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
        is applied to reduce dimensionality and extract key features, producing eigenfaces
        that represent the most significant variations in facial structures. These eigenfaces
        serve as compact and informative inputs to the classification model.
    </p>

    <h4 class="fs-3 fw-semibold mt-4">
        3. Classification and Web Integration
    </h4>

    <p class="fs-5">
            The classification stage employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained on
        labeled datasets of male and female faces. The SVM predicts gender and outputs
        confidence scores. This pipeline is integrated into a Flask web application that
        allows users to upload images and view predictions in real time. The application
        displays annotated images, grayscale ROIs, eigen images, and confidence scores,
        making the system transparent and educational.
